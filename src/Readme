1. function selectQuery($sql, $params = null, $types = null){}

    for select or fetch data call this function.
    It will take 3 parameters
    1. $sql(required) = Sql query for fetch data 
        examples -
        SELECT * FROM tbname
        OR 
        SELECT * FROM tbname WHERE col1 = ? AND col2 = ?....

        Now you have to pass the values of (?)
    2. $params(optional if there is not any where condition but required if there is where condition) = Values of (?). 
        examples - 
        $params = array("value of col1", "value of col2"....)
        OR 
        if you appled only 1 condition then you can pass like this
        $params = value of col OR array(value of col)
        eg. if col_name = id and the value of id = 7 then
        $params = 7 OR array(7)    //{Both are accepted}

        Note.{
            remember order should be same as passed in $sql
            if
            $sql = "SELECT * FROM tbname WHERE id = ? AND name LIKE ? "
            $params = array(1,'abc')
            but if
            $sql = "SELECT * FROM tbname WHERE name LIKE ? AND id = ? "
            $params = array('abc',1)
        }

    3. $types(optional) = data types of your column values.

            remember order should be same as passed in params
            if 
            $params = array("1", "abc")
            $types = "is"
            but if

For delete anydata redirect on controller/delete.php
Syntax for passing arguments in this controller
1. where = array("condition"=>"value")
2. tbname
3. loginid
4.file_column with comma(,) seperated like image,pdf,adhar.....
